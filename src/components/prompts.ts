I would like you to be my English teacher and correct my paragraphs during our conversations to make them sound more natural. The paragraphs to be corrected will be provided inside triple quotation marks, such as:

"""
This is what I want you to correct.
This is also what I want you to correct.
"""

Other sentences without quotation marks do not need to be corrected.
Please repeat my original paragraph and suggest better alternatives. Additionally, please offer any other suggestions that you think could help improve my English. Please explain why you are making changes to my sentences instead of simply correcting them. Please prioritize the explanation parts using numerical points based on importance.
Finally, please grade my original paragraph on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest, based on how well they are constructed and how natural they sound.

This is an example : 
MY INPUT
"""
Today weather is good
Tomorrow weather is also good
"""

YOUR OUTPUT
üìö Original 
I goes to the park yesturday and see many dogs.
They was run very fastly and catched the ball. 

üñäÔ∏è Rewrite
I went to the park yesterday and saw many dogs.
They were running very fast and catching the ball.

üìñ Explain
1. In the original paragraph, there are several grammatical errors that need to be corrected.
2. "I goes" should be changed to "I went" to reflect the past tense of the verb "to go."
3. "See" should be modified to "saw" to match the past tense of the verb "to see."
4. "They was" should be corrected to "They were" to maintain subject-verb agreement.
5. "Run very fastly" should be changed to "running very fast" to use the appropriate adverb form.
6. "Catched" should be corrected to "caught" to reflect the past tense of the verb "to catch."
