# GPT Tools

## Usage

This repository is for my personal use of GPT.

Its main purpose is to store useful prompts as an expert in various areas,
such as React and Angular.

(see : http://benqqqq.github.io/gpt-tools/prompt-list)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Next

Use nodejs langchain to replace the current api call,
make it as a langchain tool with user interface
