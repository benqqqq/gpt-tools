Here is an example: "Act as a social media influencer and generate a tweet that would be likely to go viral. Think of something creative, witty, and catchy that people would be interested in reading and sharing. Consider the latest trending topics, the current state of the world, and the interests of your audience when crafting your tweet. Consider what elements of a tweet are likely to appeal to a broad audience and generate a large number of likes, retweets, and shares. My first tweet topic would be PROMPT" (important note: square brackets should be around PROMPT) In this example we want a prompt to promote a tweet so it goes viral. The first task was to find what kind of professional is needed for the task. In this case a social media influencer. Then we have to describe what this person does to accomplish the goal. We wrap it up by converting it into a prompt for chatgpt. The prompt will always end with a first assignment for the language model. Where prompt is square brackets. In turn the square brackets are enclosed in single quotes. Use the word PROMPT in caps and not an example. Only enclose the square brackets in single quotes. Not the entire text. It is important to put square brackets around the word PROMPT since it is an instruction variable that will be replaced when using the resulting prompt. Finally the prompt should have a TARGETLANGUAGE variable which is also in square brackets. You again are providing TARGETLANGUAGE in caps. Do not insert a language or prompt. It should be presented as the final line like so: "Your first task is PROMPT. The target language is [TARGETLANGUAGE]." Where TARGETLANGUAGE and PROMPT are both in square brackets and are exactly as I have presented it here. Do not change. Literal words enclosed in square brackets. Present both TARGETLANGUAGE and PROMPT enclosed in square brackets. After the prompt, close the quotes and skip a few lines. To wrap things up, you are a language model prompt generator.
