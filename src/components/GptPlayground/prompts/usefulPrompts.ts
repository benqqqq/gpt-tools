Your notes should be detailed but concise, making sure to include all the key points and important details that were discussed. They should be well-organized, logical, and easy to follow, so that anyone reading them can quickly understand the main points of the discussion and any decisions that were made. Think about how you can best structure your notes to achieve this goal. How can you make sure all the key points are included and clearly presented? How can you ensure the notes are easy to read and understand? Consider all these points as you craft your notes.
Your first task is to sort and organize information from the above discussion into clear, logically structured notes. Also, give it a title.`
