Syntax
Participants
The participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. The participants or actors are rendered in order of appearance in the diagram source text. Sometimes you might want to show the participants in a different order than how they appear in the first message. It is possible to specify the actor's order of appearance by doing the following:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob
    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice

Actors
If you specifically want to use the actor symbol instead of a rectangle with text you can do so by using actor statements as per below.

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Alice
    actor Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hi Bob
    Bob->>Alice: Hi Alice

Aliases
The actor can have a convenient identifier and a descriptive label.

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Alice
    participant J as John
    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?
    J->>A: Great!

Grouping / Box
The actor(s) can be grouped in vertical boxes. You can define a color (if not, it will be transparent) and/or a descriptive label using the following notation:

box Aqua Group Description
... actors ...
end
box Group without description
... actors ...
end
box rgb(33,66,99)
... actors ...
end
INFO

If your group name is a color you can force the color to be transparent:

box transparent Aqua
... actors ...
end
Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    box Purple Alice & John
    participant A
    participant J
    end
    box Another Group
    participant B
    participant C
    end
    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?
    J->>A: Great!
    A->>B: Hello Bob, how is Charly ?
    B->>C: Hello Charly, how are you?

Messages
Messages can be of two displayed either solid or with a dotted line.

[Actor][Arrow][Actor]:Message text
There are six types of arrows currently supported:

Type\tDescription
->\tSolid line without arrow
-->\tDotted line without arrow
->>\tSolid line with arrowhead
-->>\tDotted line with arrowhead
-x\tSolid line with a cross at the end
--x\tDotted line with a cross at the end.
-)\tSolid line with an open arrow at the end (async)
--)\tDotted line with a open arrow at the end (async)

Activations
It is possible to activate and deactivate an actor. (de)activation can be dedicated declarations:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    activate John
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    deactivate John

There is also a shortcut notation by appending +/- suffix to the message arrow:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>-Alice: Great!

Activations can be stacked for same actor:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!

Notes
It is possible to add notes to a sequence diagram. This is done by the notation Note [ right of | left of | over ] [Actor]: Text in note content

See the example below:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant John
    Note right of John: Text in note

It is also possible to create notes spanning two participants:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
    Note over Alice,John: A typical interaction

It is also possible to add a line break (applies to text input in general):

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
    Note over Alice,John: A typical interaction<br/>But now in two lines

Loops
It is possible to express loops in a sequence diagram. This is done by the notation

loop Loop text
... statements ...
end
See the example below:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Every minute
        John-->Alice: Great!
    end
  Alt
It is possible to express alternative paths in a sequence diagram. This is done by the notation

alt Describing text
... statements ...
else
... statements ...
end
or if there is sequence that is optional (if without else).

opt Describing text
... statements ...
end
See the example below:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    alt is sick
        Bob->>Alice: Not so good :(
    else is well
        Bob->>Alice: Feeling fresh like a daisy
    end
    opt Extra response
        Bob->>Alice: Thanks for asking
    end  
Parallel
It is possible to show actions that are happening in parallel.

This is done by the notation

par [Action 1]
... statements ...
and [Action 2]
... statements ...
and [Action N]
... statements ...
end
See the example below:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    par Alice to Bob
        Alice->>Bob: Hello guys!
    and Alice to John
        Alice->>John: Hello guys!
    end
    Bob-->>Alice: Hi Alice!
    John-->>Alice: Hi Alice!
It is also possible to nest parallel blocks.

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    par Alice to Bob
        Alice->>Bob: Go help John
    and Alice to John
        Alice->>John: I want this done today
        par John to Charlie
            John->>Charlie: Can we do this today?
        and John to Diana
            John->>Diana: Can you help us today?
        end
    end
	
It is also possible to nest parallel blocks.

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    par Alice to Bob
        Alice->>Bob: Go help John
    and Alice to John
        Alice->>John: I want this done today
        par John to Charlie
            John->>Charlie: Can we do this today?
        and John to Diana
            John->>Diana: Can you help us today?
        end
    end

Critical Region
It is possible to show actions that must happen automatically with conditional handling of circumstances.

This is done by the notation

critical [Action that must be performed]
... statements ...
option [Circumstance A]
... statements ...
option [Circumstance B]
... statements ...
end
See the example below:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    critical Establish a connection to the DB
        Service-->DB: connect
    option Network timeout
        Service-->Service: Log error
    option Credentials rejected
        Service-->Service: Log different error
    end

It is also possible to have no options at all

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    critical Establish a connection to the DB
        Service-->DB: connect
    end
This critical block can also be nested, equivalently to the par statement as seen above.

Break
It is possible to indicate a stop of the sequence within the flow (usually used to model exceptions).

This is done by the notation

break [something happened]
... statements ...
end
See the example below:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Consumer-->API: Book something
    API-->BookingService: Start booking process
    break when the booking process fails
        API-->Consumer: show failure
    end
    API-->BillingService: Start billing process

Background Highlighting
It is possible to highlight flows by providing colored background rects. This is done by the notation

The colors are defined using rgb and rgba syntax.

rect rgb(0, 255, 0)
... content ...
end
rect rgba(0, 0, 255, .1)
... content ...
end
See the examples below:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant John

    rect rgb(191, 223, 255)
    note right of Alice: Alice calls John.
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    rect rgb(200, 150, 255)
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    end
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!
    end
    Alice ->>+ John: Did you want to go to the game tonight?
    John -->>- Alice: Yeah! See you there.

Comments
Comments can be entered within a sequence diagram, which will be ignored by the parser. Comments need to be on their own line, and must be prefaced with %% (double percent signs). Any text after the start of the comment to the next newline will be treated as a comment, including any diagram syntax

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    %% this is a comment
    John-->>Alice: Great!

Entity codes to escape characters
It is possible to escape characters using the syntax exemplified here.

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    A->>B: I #9829; you!
    B->>A: I #9829; you #infin; times more!

Numbers given are base 10, so # can be encoded as #35;. It is also supported to use HTML character names.

Because semicolons can be used instead of line breaks to define the markup, you need to use #59; to include a semicolon in message text.

sequenceNumbers
It is possible to get a sequence number attached to each arrow in a sequence diagram. This can be configured when adding mermaid to the website as shown below:

html
<script>
  mermaid.initialize({ sequence: { showSequenceNumbers: true } });
</script>
It can also be turned on via the diagram code as in the diagram:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!

Actor Menus
Actors can have popup-menus containing individualized links to external pages. For example, if an actor represented a web service, useful links might include a link to the service health dashboard, repo containing the code for the service, or a wiki page describing the service.

This can be configured by adding one or more link lines with the format:

link <actor>: <link-label> @ <link-url>
Code:
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant John
    link Alice: Dashboard @ https://dashboard.contoso.com/alice
    link Alice: Wiki @ https://wiki.contoso.com/alice
    link John: Dashboard @ https://dashboard.contoso.com/john
    link John: Wiki @ https://wiki.contoso.com/john
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    Alice-)John: See you later!

Advanced Menu Syntax
There is an advanced syntax that relies on JSON formatting. If you are comfortable with JSON format, then this exists as well.

This can be configured by adding the links lines with the format:

links <actor>: <json-formatted link-name link-url pairs>
An example is below:

Code:
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant John
    links Alice: {"Dashboard": "https://dashboard.contoso.com/alice", "Wiki": "https://wiki.contoso.com/alice"}
    links John: {"Dashboard": "https://dashboard.contoso.com/john", "Wiki": "https://wiki.contoso.com/john"}
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    Alice-)John: See you later!
