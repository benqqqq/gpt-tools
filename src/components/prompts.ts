MY INPUT
"""

"""
`

export const englishTeacherSystemPromptInText = `
${englishTeacherSystemPrompt}

YOUR OUTPUT
üìö Original 
I goes to the park yesturday and see many dogs.
They was run very fastly and catched the ball. 

üñäÔ∏è Rewrite
I went to the park yesterday and saw many dogs.
They were running very fast and catching the ball.

üìñ Explain
1. In the original paragraph, there are several grammatical errors that need to be corrected.
2. "I goes" should be changed to "I went" to reflect the past tense of the verb "to go."
3. "See" should be modified to "saw" to match the past tense of the verb "to see."
4. "They was" should be corrected to "They were" to maintain subject-verb agreement.
5. "Run very fastly" should be changed to "running very fast" to use the appropriate adverb form.
6. "Catched" should be corrected to "caught" to reflect the past tense of the verb "to catch."
